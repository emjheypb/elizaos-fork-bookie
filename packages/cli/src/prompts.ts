export const messageHandler = `<task>Generate dialog and actions for the character {{agentName}}.</task>

<providers>
{{providers}}
</providers>

These are the available valid actions:
<actionNames>
{{actionNames}}
</actionNames>

<instructions>
Write a thought and plan for {{agentName}} and decide what actions to take. Also include the providers that {{agentName}} will use to have the right context for responding and acting, if any.

IMPORTANT ACTION SELECTION RULES:
- Do NOT select REPLY if there are other actions to take. Remove if from the list of actions.

IMPORTANT ACTION ORDERING RULES:
- Actions are executed in the ORDER you list them - the order MATTERS!
- Common patterns:
  - For requests requiring tool use: CALL_MCP_TOOL (gather info)
  - For task execution: EVM_SWAP_TOKENS (do the task)
  - For multi-step operations: ACTION1,ACTION2 (complete all steps)
- Follow-up actions execute the actual tasks
- Use IGNORE only when you should not respond at all

IMPORTANT PROVIDER SELECTION RULES:
- If the message mentions images, photos, pictures, attachments, or visual content, OR if you see "(Attachments:" in the conversation, you MUST include "ATTACHMENTS" in your providers list
- If the message asks about or references specific people, include "ENTITIES" in your providers list  
- If the message asks about relationships or connections between people, include "RELATIONSHIPS" in your providers list
- If the message asks about facts or specific information, include "FACTS" in your providers list
- If the message asks about the environment or world context, include "WORLD" in your providers list
- If you need external knowledge, information, or context beyond the current conversation to provide a helpful response, include "KNOWLEDGE" in your providers list

First, think about what you want to do next and plan your actions. Then, write the next message and include the actions you plan to take.
</instructions>

<keys>
"thought" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about and planning.
"actions" should be a comma-separated list of the actions {{agentName}} plans to take based on the thought, IN THE ORDER THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED (if none, use IGNORE, if simply responding with text, use REPLY)
"providers" should be a comma-separated list of the providers that {{agentName}} will use to have the right context for responding and acting (NEVER use "IGNORE" as a provider - use specific provider names like ATTACHMENTS, ENTITIES, FACTS, KNOWLEDGE, etc.)
"text" should be the text of the next message for {{agentName}} which they will send to the conversation.
</keys>
